        <strong>Contact Policy:</strong> I maintain active professional profiles on several recruiting platforms, including

        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/michael-widener-ii" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>. However I apply directly via the employer or employment entity's guidance. I do not sign Rights of Representation with Recruiters and then pitch my employment to employers for a commission. This approach has not produced successful employment for me. It is too costly for employers in my experience.

      <h2>Career Path &amp; Education</h2>
      <p>
        My career unites design and analytics across multiple industries. From early multimedia development to data-driven
        web experience strategy, I’ve built digital systems that communicate clearly, scale efficiently, and deliver quantifiable results. 
        My academic foundation in Digital Design &amp; Development enables me to work fluently between creative ideation and technical execution.

    <section id="ai-policy">
      <h2>AI Policy</h2>
      <p>
        I work directly with Artificial Intelligence to manage a higher volume of work with greater accuracy. 
        AI does not alter my message, my creativity, or the originality of my ideas—it simply accelerates the execution. 
        Routine tasks such as converting documents between Word, PDF, and web formats (HTML/CSS) are delegated to AI under my instruction,
        allowing me to focus on design, strategy, and quality. By integrating AI as a precision tool rather than a substitute for thought,
        I’ve quadrupled my productivity while maintaining full authorship of every project.
      </p>

    <section id="ai-integration">
      <h2>AI Integration &amp; Mastery</h2>
      <p>
        Over the past several years, I’ve worked daily with AI systems like ChatGPT to refine, automate, and enhance my design, analytics, 
        and documentation workflows. My ongoing conversation history spans thousands of exchanges—effectively a multi-year collaboration 
        that mirrors professional mentorship. I use AI as both a creative and analytical assistant: to prototype web designs, validate data logic, 
        explore visual storytelling ideas, and draft professional communications. This extensive experience shows employers that I’m not just 
        familiar with AI—I’m fluent in integrating it as a tool for efficiency, creativity, and decision-support in real-world projects.

    <section id="recruiter-access" class="block">
      <h2>Recruiter Access</h2>
      <p class="small">
        I work with third-party recruiters exclusively via Indeed.com or LinkedIn.com:<br>
        <a href="https://indeed.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">https://indeed.com</a><br>
        <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/michael-widener-ii" target="_self" rel="noopener">https://linkedin.com/in/michael-widener-ii</a>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="contact-policy" class="block">
      <h2>Contact Policy</h2>
      <p class="small">
        I apply to open roles directly with the employer. I am not represented by a recruiter. If I work with a third-party recruiter, a commisssioned head-hunter not working for the employer (but wishing to secure a Right to Represent Agreement directly with me and then present me to their employer-client), I exclusively work with that complicated scenario via LinkedIn or Indeed.com. I do not respond to third-party recruiter solitication in any other way.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="application-policy" class="block">
      <h2>Application Policy</h2>
      <p class="small">
        I am applying to matching roles and I do not apply with competing recruiters for the same role. All recruiting
        must go through my LinkedIn so I can enforce first-mover, first-insight advantage—my way of rewarding recruiters
        who recognize my value before others approach. The world isn’t perfectly fair, but we can carve out small slices
        of fairness — and this is mine.
