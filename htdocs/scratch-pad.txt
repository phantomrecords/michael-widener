A dating network operator routinely opens different web domain names and shares the membership across the domain names to increase the amount of members who can see each other. Reputable dating operators, like QPidNetwork, and from my personal experience of the last four years and counting, do this responsibly and members have no complaints and are happy with their profile shared to more daters. Irresponsible operators, from my personal experience, do this to overwhelm their daters so that their daters never choose a date and instead spend thousands of dollars meeting new dates, and also, allow dates to be paid members who entice daters to spend money messaging dates that are paid to message back and banned from dating the person whom they are messaging. That part of the dating website practice is irresponsible and I find that it amounts to fraud, or a scam practice commonly referred to as Romance Scamming. QPidNetwork has not engaged in this fraud in my personal experience as a member since the U.S. Pandemic began, even though they have faced financial hardship in their country as much as any other operator in any country around the world. That is why I consider QPidNetwork to be reputable - it resists the pressure to become irresponsible while other dating sites embrace it and become romance scammers. Several I have personal experience as a paying member have resorted to romance scamming to bilk members out of thousands of dollars per month and continue to update and edit their Terms and Conditions to place the burden on members for learning of their irresponsible pricing, instead of following regulated, enforced Trade Practices that ban the practice. I hope regulators get around to cracking down on and fining the bad actors in this space, so responsible daters, like me, can be free of the burden of policing these scammers. Policing them is not my job. I'm not paid for doing that, although it pays to do it to evade scams that would otherwise drain my payment methods, unscrupulously. Find Member ID CM75470014.
