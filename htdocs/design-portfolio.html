As of October 7, 2025 (Pacific Standard Time)

<br/><br/>

<div style="text-align:justify;">

This year, I designed, built, and launched <strong><a href="https://djx.vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DJX.Vegas</a></strong> — a fully self-produced website that serves as the official hub for my recorded DJ experiences. Every element — from the layout and graphics to the music itself — was created by me using GoDaddy’s site builder as my web-design canvas and professional audio production software as my Mixtape canvas. 

<br /><br />

I experimented with multiple systems for streaming, audience engagement, and business integration before choosing to manage  everything through GoDaddy. This approach allows my mixes to be heard exactly as intended: clean, immersive, and uninterrupted by ads or third-party clutter. The building platform is comfortable for me and that frees me from overly technical interfaces, so I can focus on what matters most — viewing the site as my audience does and ensuring every visit feels effortless.

<br/><br/>

Each set features my own blend of old-school rhythm and flirty-pop EDM, often infused with the same cinematic energy that fuels my gaming projects. While I enjoy cooperative and solo games, I’m not drawn to “death matches” or player-versus-player chaos.

<br/><br/>

E-Sports has evolved into a global arena, but <strong>DJX.Vegas</strong> is meant for easy enjoyment — a background-level listening experience. My focus isn’t on personality; it’s on peaceful immersion. I don’t talk over the music or break the mood with commentary. What you’ll experience is pure motion and sound — a reflection of the craft itself, not the performer. To be my fan is to appreciate the art, not the image. Looks fade; the work endures.

<h2 class="section-heading">My Jedi Path</h2>

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align:justify;">
Movies have always been more than entertainment to me—they’re a shared language. When people connect through the same stories, told in the same cultural voice, they discover a sense of belonging. American cinema, in particular, carries a unique perspective because it reflects a nation unlike any other.
<br/><br/>
I’ve always been captivated by storytelling in all its forms—from <em>Star Wars</em> to <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>The Rings of Power</em>, and <em>The Wheel of Time</em>. I’m equally drawn to science and imagination, having read Stephen Hawking’s <em>A Brief History of Time</em> cover to cover. Beyond the screen, I appreciate the artistry behind productions like <em>Star Trek</em>—from the creative teams who build worlds to the fans who celebrate them through cosplay. I value creativity, intellect, and fairness—and I believe calm collaboration always outperforms chaos.
<br/><br/>
That same connection between imagination and purpose eventually led me toward my faith. My creative path and spiritual journey have always mirrored each other. For years, I explored the idea of “agency”—first as a design principle in my 2005 thesis on video game storytelling, and later as a principle of personal responsibility. That exploration guided me to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, where the concept of being an <em>agent</em> in one’s life carries profound meaning.
<br/><br/>
When I discovered <em>The Jedi Path</em> book in 2010, I didn’t realize how closely its values aligned with my beliefs. After joining the Church just over a year ago, I began to see it clearly. The faith aligns with everything in me—personal discipline, service, balance, and integrity, including my work ethic. Looking back, my creative work had been leading me here all along. The transformation hasn’t been about becoming someone new, but about recognizing the consistent thread between my art, my ethics, and my beliefs. Those who meet me now may notice a difference—it’s one of clarity, not change.
<br/><br/>
I often return to this line from <em>Star Wars</em>, which applies as much to design as it does to life:
<br/><br/>
<blockquote style="margin:0; padding-left:1em; border-left:4px solid #ccc;"> <p style="margin:0;"><strong>“You will know what to do and what is true when you are calm—when you feel peaceful, not while you are angry.”</strong></p> <p style="margin:0;"><b>&mdash; Yoda, <em>Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi</em></b></p> </blockquote>

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align:justify;">

If you’re not as movie-obsessed as I am, this might sound unusual: films are one of America’s most shared languages. When we love the same stories for the same reasons, we feel like part of the same cohort. U.S. movies have a distinct voice—shaped by a country that’s unlike anywhere else.

<br/><br/>

I’m a Star Wars fan, a science fan (I read Stephen Hawking’s <em>A Brief History of Time</em> cover to cover), and a fan of fantasy. I love <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, <em>The Rings of Power</em>, <em>The Wheel of Time</em>, and the many films that celebrate these worlds. I also love Star Trek—the performers, the crews behind the scenes, and the fans who bring it all to life through cosplay. I’m all in on imagination; I’m not into real-world drunkenness, rowdiness, or violence, and I have little patience for unfairness.

<br/><br/>

Why share this here? Because my creative work and my inner life have the same arc. In searching for my purpose—my “Jedi Path”—I found it in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A core idea there is being an <em>agent</em> in one’s life, acting with intent. Back in 2005, for my senior thesis (one of two), I explored “agency” as a design principle for great video games. It turns out that agency in faith is where that thread led. Some of us chase our tails for a while; I’m grateful I finally caught mine.

<br/><br/>

I even bought <em>The Jedi Path</em> in 2010. Its values share surprising overlap with my faith. Consciously and subconsciously, I’ve been walking toward this for years—and even as an honors student, it still took time for the pattern to click. The change isn’t a new persona; it’s clarity. If you knew me before, you may notice a shift. That’s a good thing.

<br/><br/>

Life tends to guide us where we need to go. One passage from Star Wars has stayed with me:

<br/><br/>

<blockquote style="margin:0; padding-left:1em; border-left:4px solid #ccc;">
  <p style="margin:0;"><strong>“You will know what to do and what is true when you are calm—when you feel peaceful, not while you are angry.”</strong></p>
  <p style="margin:0;"><b>&mdash; Yoda, <em>Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi</em></b></p>
</blockquote>

      Drawing from Māori restorative justice principles and Maidu community policing ideals learned in Reno, Nevada (where their policing is akin to a Police Department for their lands), I’ve created a digital court workflow that's electronic and keeps the data (which is dummy data for now) private. It's still in beta and when building a site, software devleopers use placeholder data long before anything real happens. It goes through real stress testing with real poeple but none of those people are in real cases. It is akin to a theatre show where real people have characters they play to test the online system. It takes months. Although it's a test, the system is real once it starts working, even if it's still in beta-test mode.

        I’m now a Student A/V Engineer at a professional recording studio serving podcasters, recording artists, and independent filmmakers on my school's campus. I never needed anything else for what I do.  Every day, I help creators find their voice—and then make sure that voice is crystal clear, emotionally rich, and production-ready.

        <br/><br/>

        Whether I’m mic’ing up a storyteller, mixing a vocal session, or mastering sound for cinema, I bring the same Jedi-level discipline I’ve used in multimedia and animation: 
        balance, timing, precision, and feel. I translate raw takes into polished soundscapes that elevate the message and honor the vision.

        <br/><br/>

        This isn’t just a job. It’s a daily discipline. Audio is now the medium where my technical skills, artistic instincts, and years of digital craftsmanship meet in real time—with real impact. 
        Every day, I make sure the story gets heard, exactly the way it’s meant to be.

    <div class="timeline-body">
      <p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">
        I’m stepping into a new frontier: fusing CSS animation with audio-reactive design—tiny, nuanced animations choreographed to my own DJ-mixed music. This isn’t just syncing beats with visuals. It’s crafting emotional, immersive “micro-experiences” that pulse with personality and precision. I’ve always believed animation is more than eye candy—it’s timing, passion, intent, and soul. Now, I’m applying those principles in tandem with sound I personally mix.

        <br/><br/>

        What sets this apart is that the rhythm, pacing, and energy come from my own mixes—sometimes commercial tracks, sometimes my original Flirty-POP EDM productions. The result? Custom-crafted experiences that feel alive because they <em>are</em>. Designed. Mixed. Timed. All by one creative mind; and, based on my real-life experiences, so in a very real way, they are totally alive!

        <br/><br/>

        I’m not chasing flash. I’m surfing <strong>passion</strong>! Understated. Epic. Unmistakably me; but, passion none the less!

<h4>2016 - 2023</h4>
<h4 class="subheading">Mastered CSS Image-Animation: <br/>Worked Independently.</h4>
</div>
<div class="timeline-body">
<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">I've been building websites professionally since 2016, working with everyone from small business owners to massive organizations like IBM and the Department of Defense. Many of my clients came to me after buying fancy websites they didn’t have the time or skills to maintain. I stepped in not only to keep things running, but to help them understand what was working, what wasn’t, and how to fix it. Along the way, I gained firsthand knowledge about how decisions get made inside big corporations versus small businesses—and what it really takes to get results in each world. Whether it was working as a solo entrepreneur or as part of a team buried under layers of subcontracting, I learned how to adapt and deliver.

<br/>
<br/>

Now I've mastered CSS Image-Animation, which is a very specialized application of multimedia, web, graphic, hand-coding, timing, and technical savvy. It’s where art meets engineering. I use it to bring websites and digital content to life—adding movement, rhythm, and emotion to things most people think of as static. It’s a rare skill, and I’ve made it my signature. It’s not just about making things look cool (though they do); it’s about making digital experiences feel natural, fluid, and alive.

<strong>What's Next?</strong> What's next is that I'm going to animate these tiny experiences and 'time them' to DJ-mixed music I make. I may animate them to commercial music or I may choose Flirty-POP EDM. I haven't decided. But it'll be epic (in an under-stated way; I guarantee that!

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Michael initially struggled with pricing his services, inadvertently undercharging for the quality he provided. This led to attracting clients who undervalued his work, often expecting services for free. Through these challenges, Michael learned the importance of establishing clear legal agreements to ensure payment for services rendered. To further enhance his skills, he enrolled in Full Sail University, aiming to refine his craft even though his quality was already well-regarded. However, the difficulty in holding clients accountable eventually prompted Michael to leave school and focus on finding stable work opportunities instead.

<div class="timeline-body">
<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from American University, Michael applied his education and experience to develop Phantom Records' website into a rich, multimedia, database-driven site. After updating the site to the most modern it can be, his employer, Phantom Records, moved the site into maintenance mode. Without a site to apply his talents, Michael negotiated the option to take on contracts that would allow him to remain current and broaden his skill set. Between 2013 and now, Michael completed several contracts building sites for the TSA, the Glenmont United Methodist Church, and a start-up government contractor.

<br/>
<br/>

Now that Michael has demonstrated his ability to create modern, database-driven websites, he is broadening his skill set with bleeding-edge Web Design, JavaScript Web Development, and Data Visualization Programming for the NIH. Michael's longer-term plan is to master both the creative and technical aspects of creating electronic experiences. Additionally, he is under the direction of his mentor, learning the software development lifecycle to round out his skills with project management and business development. In a few years, his expertise will equip him to contribute to enterprise-level, web-based projects and step in at any stage to ensure the beauty of its design, the soundness of its programming, and the success of the project through professional project management. He will be a valuable asset on any web-based project.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after Michael was hired at a promising new start-up, the tragic events of 9/11 led investors to withdraw funding, forcing the company to shut down. With start-up funding drying up across Silicon Valley, Michael decided it was the perfect opportunity to return to school. Seeking a more fulfilling educational experience, he moved to the East Coast and enrolled at American University, where he designed a unique degree program combining Graphic Design, Multimedia, and Web Programming. This initiative led to Michael earning the only Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Design and Development in the University's history. While attending school part-time, he worked part-time to immediately apply his studies to real-world projects. On May 8, 2011, he graduated with a 3.49 GPA and was honored to walk with the University’s top-performing students.

<h4>1996 - 2000</h4>
<h4 class="subheading">Overseas Travel - Web Research.</h4>
</div>
<div class="timeline-body" style="text-align:justify;">
<p class="text-muted">When traveling between school and work became too grueling, Michael's high school friend invited him to move to New Zealand for a change of pace. There, Michael created an online video game retailer that received 1.2 million hits in its first year. He and his partner made the front page of New Zealand's largest newspaper and were featured on television as an innovative, technology-based retailer. At the time, theirs was the only website featuring videos of gameplay to overcome buyer's reluctance and give customers a preview of gameplay before purchasing. A little-known fact about Michael is that Amazon.com cited Michael's website, www.gamescape.co.nz, in its Patent document US7792705. You can copy and paste this link to see that document and search for www.gamescape.co.nz to see Michael's citation at: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7792705">patents.google.com</a>.

<br/>
<br/>

During the time Michael was in New Zealand, the dot-com bubble started growing. Unemployment in the U. S. hit an all-time low of 4.6%. Tech companies were searching high and low for creative talent to fuel innovative start-ups. When Michael's parent learned of this, they made Michael move back to the United States to seek more lucrative employment than they estimated he would find in New Zealand. Michael was engaged to get married and he was forced to break off his engagement and leave his girlfriend. It set a stage for a tumultuous relationship with his parents from then onward.


<br/>
<br/>

Michael moved back to the United States to leverage his experience in his New Zealand start-up and grow his experience in the larger, more competitive U. S. market. In Los Gatos, California, Michael learned the value of separating the front-end from the back-end so specialized talent can be more productive. Michael was promoted to Product Manager after creating a prototype to redesign his employer's software interface based on user feedback. Later, he was promoted to Director of User Interface Design. Michael's work helped sell their web application and their start-up for several hundred thousand dollars and won Michael an invitation to join the same executive team at their next start-up.

<p class="text-muted">After feeling disconnected from the workforce for too long, yet realizing he needed to remain current with evolving technologies, Michael decided to take a new approach: to work while going to school. He took a job at a computer store as a salesperson and technician so he could personally build the products he sold. He also attended animation school to continue his pursuit of digital design. He learned customer service and technical support and then moved on to network administration, obtaining his Novell Netware Certification and earning $60 an hour doing network "house calls." Michael's boss called his computers "bullet-proof." It may have had something to do with Michael's 27-step preparation plan used on every computer he built.

Michael became an IT Assistant at the George Lucas Educational Foundation where he improved his computer support skills while studying the convergence of education and technology in the Foundation's specialized education technology library. He also used Mozilla during its first launch and was excited about his future. Researching the Foundation's library revealed a computer animation school in Sunnyvale, California. Immediately following his internship's end, Michael applied, was accepted, enrolled and moved to Sunnyvale to attend.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Michael got his first job in Graphic Design at a small design studio in Oakland, California. Back then, computers were slower and relatively more expensive. Michael learned to design on a small black and white screen using Super Paint on a Mac SE/30 and ran the mail merge for the studio's marketing campaign using Microsoft Word. The company was attempting a Work from Home model and if only A.I. had been available then, we could have done it, successfully. Work from Home offices are less likely to suffer a pandemic and less likely to spread infectious disease between workers.

Michael attended CPS in Oakland, California, where he acclimated to intellectual rigor, problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork through sports. The University of California recognizes CPS as an honors institution because all classes are taught at the honors level. Michael graduated with a 3.5 GPA, which, when adjusted for honors-level coursework, translates to a 4.5 GPA under the grading system used by post-secondary institutions and universities.

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align:justify;">

You’ve seen animation in Pixar films or classic movie openings like *The Matrix* and *Spider-Man.* My work lives in a different space—one that blends storytelling with interface design.

<br/><br/>

I create motion graphics for the web and immersive experiences—ranging from subtle CSS hover effects to 3D character animations synchronized with music.

<br/><br/>

Using tools such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, After Effects, and Adobe Aero, I bring interfaces and characters to life—sometimes even using motion capture from my own choreography to animate humanoid digital assets. In the industry, these animated models are referred to as “assets.”

<br/><br/>

Think of them as small, expressive moments that enhance user interaction, connect to rhythm and motion, and make digital design feel alive.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">After creating hollywood quality animations for this project, Michael received feedback that he only had to make very simply, slow-moving animations because the senior customers viewing the animations were likely only interested in that, instead of something too fancy. Michael created these to accomodate the Client's request. These are very easy to make and fun to make in various colors or to make various alternatives such as ones that play normally and ones that play on holidays with different, festive animations. <a class="portfolio-link" data-toggle="modal" href="#portfolioModalAARP">See one of them here</a>.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">This text left here for die-hard animation fans. (Otherwise, it's too much information.) Michael created an interactive "mini game" animation to represent the "Peace Process" in an interesting way. He bought a dance pad with a USB cable connection. The dance pad is three feet by three feet wide. He then designed a "cover" for the pad. His "cover" was also three feet by three, designed in Adobe Photoshop and created at full print quality: 300DPI. That is an extremely large file and it was very time consuming to work with but Michael believes in quality and flexibility so he did it anyway. He had the "cover" printed at FedEx Office on to vinyl paper. The then "stuck" the "cover" on top of the dance pad so that his "pictures" precisely covered the dance pad's contact points. In other words, a dancer stepping on his "pictures" would activate the "hotspots" beneath the "cover" and send a signal into the "mini game" he created. The "mini game" was made in Adobe Flash, and he used a small Mac OS X utlitity to interpret the dance pad's "buttons" to send keyboard keystrokes depending on which one was "stepped on" or "pressed." The keystrokes were then mapped, within Flash, to activate certain animation sequences. During his design process, it was told to Michael that moving within Flash from one "Scene" to another the way Michael wanted was impossible. Michael searched Google for three days and found the same claim. So what did he do? He guessed. Based on the "syntax" of ActionScript, Michael created an original code sequence and it worked.</p><p></p>

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">"Kinetic Type" is a type of animation with moving text. Movies that have opening sequences with elaborate movements, such as the Spiderman movies, where the camera moves around the web hopping from one text phrase to another, are using "Kinetic Type" or "moving text." Michael used Adobe After Effects to create this animation. But with this one, he also used his DJ-skill to "time" the animation to the audio in the attached sound file. An author read their famous passage from "Lenore," and Michael animated the entire portion. This is only a portion, as the project was split between Michael and others. This is Michael's portion.</p>

"Motion Graphics" are animations created to show in video footage. I majored in the science of multimedia, including web, animation, or video-displayed-animations (motion graphics). Those are animation that are specifically created to appear "on top of" video footage. In the video attached here, all of the text is animated. The footage was captured from source DVDs and then I added music to the background for the right vibe. I also selected and editing the timing in all of the footage and chose all of the tranisitions. I used Adobe Creative Cloud, and Apple Final Cut Pro to do this. You can't tell which parts are original and which parts are from the DVDs I captured or from the Xbox console I capture while playing video games to illustrate the point I am making in this video because the style I chose for my work blends so seamelessly in appearance and timing that you don't know which is which. That's because that's how talented I am. I did that deliberatel. Because that's what a professional does when they work to integrate their work within existing work.</p>

<h3 class="section-subheading text-muted col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3" style="text-align:justify;">

In the United States, higher education changed dramatically after the 1970s, when universities began charging tuition to U.S. citizens. Since then, the cost of a degree has grown to rival or even exceed that of a home. Unlike real estate, education doesn’t gain value by itself—its worth depends on how each graduate applies what they’ve learned.​

<br/><br/>

A diploma reflects perseverance more than profit. It’s evidence of commitment and resilience through a system designed to test ethics and character as much as intellect. Employers understand this. They value degrees not only for knowledge, but for the discipline, responsibility, and integrity they represent.​

<br/><br/>

That’s why this section exists. Education often says more about a person’s values than a résumé ever could.​

<br/><br/>

At my university, I graduated with honors—not only for academic excellence, but for upholding high standards of character. I was the only student in my class appointed to two Judiciary Committees at once, a responsibility I took seriously as a leader among my peers.​

<br/><br/>

Some have tried to misrepresent that truth. But education isn’t about appearances or paper credentials—it’s about transformation. True education reshapes the mind, sharpens critical thinking, and strengthens integrity.​

<br/><br/>

Many colleges today focus on graduation rates to secure funding. My path was different. I chose a fully endowed, independent institution that values principle over profit. That distinction matters.​

<br/><br/>

And one last reflection: education should expand the mind, not dull it. No matter how many degrees someone holds, if learning hasn’t helped them overcome destructive habits, its purpose has been missed. Real education uplifts thought, clarifies choices, and frees the mind.​

<img alt="Website Conception, Design, Development, and Operation" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/DJX-Vegas-Home-Page-Screenshot-400x289.png"/>

<p>I conceived this business after federal laws governing online music ventures finally stabilized into something I could confidently follow. These laws, shaped by the aftermath of the Napster file-sharing scandal, took decades to move through United States courts. Once final decisions and judgments were made, the legal landscape could at last be interpreted with clarity.

<br />
<br />

Since 2000, my plans had been on hold while this process unfolded—delaying my progress for 25 years. Now, my site is complete, representing the culmination of that long wait and creative persistence. The business originally known as Phantom Records, GP is now renamed Michael Widener, GP (as of 2025).

<img alt="Mini Game" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/step-stand-disarm.jpg"/>
<p>Michael designed this mini game in  Flash. It connects to a dance pad that has a large three foot by three foot vinyl  printed graphic that covers the pad. The graphics are arranged on top of the  dance pad sensors. Stepping on the pad in the middle starts the game.</p>
<p>Online, you can see the visual part of the this design. But you'd have to visit one of his exhibits to see the physical setup.</p>

<img alt="United Bank website screen" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/gamescape-dvd-menus.jpg"/>
<p>Michael designed a DVD menu system and edited the video using Photoshop, Final Cut Pro, Motion, and DVD Studio Pro. He also created custom timed mixes to go with the introduction video that runs  when the DVD is inserted. He also narrated the audio commentary included in the  DVD's special features.</p>
<p>The DVD uses a naming convention  inspired by real-time strategy games. The main menu is called "Base  Camp." The chapters menu is called "Waypoints." And the special  features menu is called "Gear."</p>
<p>The "Gear" menu includes a  custom design featuring running videos that are clickable to jump to the  corresponding section of the DVD. Completing this effect required adding  Photoshop masks to the Final Cut footage in the exact shape of the monitor  screens in the background. The video appears to exist in the monitor, but in  fact it is floating on top.</p>

<h2>Double O Technologies</h2>
<p class="item-intro text-muted">Website Design &amp; Branded Contract Writing</p>
<img alt="Double O Technologies" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/double-o-tech-large.jpg"/>
<p>Michael is collaborating with this agile, intelligent, and fast-growing start-up—serving both government and commercial clients—to create a website that reflects the company’s energetic culture. He is incorporating animation, third-party integrations with Facebook, Twitter, and Google Fonts, an advanced calendar featuring Facebook-based event scheduling, an employee scheduling web application, PayPal integration, and an overall design that conveys the passion of the dynamic team driving this start-up.
<br/><br/>
As if that were not enough, Michael is also drawing on his upbringing in a family of lawyers to craft customized, branded contracts for the Client. Management can now negotiate, organize, and build a pool of talent based on professional, enforceable agreements written in clear, plain English. All contracts are vetted for legal validity by attorneys practicing in Maryland.
<br/><br/>
By combining his literary abilities with his skill in legal writing, Michael has saved his Client thousands of dollars by delivering complete, well-structured documents that clearly express the Client’s objectives. This approach eliminates the need for multiple, costly revisions at an attorney’s hourly rate. With Michael’s version, only a single legal review is needed to finalize a binding contract that retains all the intended business nuance and complexity—strengthened by carefully reworked and reworded provisions. It’s a highly efficient and productive collaboration.</p>

<img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/changes-dj-mix-large.png" style="border: 1px solid black; padding-bottom: 0px;"/>
<p>Michael created and produced this commercial DJ mix for Phantom Records. It features one of Will Smith's hit  singles, "Wild <span class="SpellE">Wild</span> West." It appeals to  pop music and rap fans because it includes one of Will Smith's greatest hits  apart from "Summertime." There are other old school hits such as  "The Humpty Dance" by Digital Underground, who are close personal  friends of Michael's. Digital Underground's head DJ, DJ Fuse, taught Michael to  DJ when Michael was in high school. One of the group's members is Michael's  best high school friend's relative. There is a long history of Michael and the music industry, and his talent for making music that energizes listeners has been among  his lesser-known abilities. <br/><br/>As passionate as Michael is about music, his "somewhat" shy nature (believe it or not) kept him from becoming a stage DJ. But don't take our word for it,  listen for yourself.</p>

<p>Michael created and produced this commercial DJ mix for Phantom Records. It features Faith Evans'  "Faithfully," and appeals to those of us who remember the 80s and 90s  pop songs we danced to in high school (back when house parties were still safe).</p>

<img alt="U. S. American University Graduation Note" class="img-responsive img-centered" src="./img/AU-Website-Snapshot-720x1149.png"/>
<p>I graduated from American University with the school’s only Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Design and Development. I customized their Bachelor of Arts in Multimedia program into a Science degree to emphasize Computing, focusing on website-related coding technologies such as PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and streaming animation, audio, and video. By combining these disciplines, I reached the state of the art in web design.
Since graduating, I’ve continued to stay current with emerging technologies and created my latest modern website:
<a href="https://djx.vegas/">https://djx.vegas</a>. Visit the site to see how I’ve applied this education in practice.</p>

<p>Michael created this Kinetic Type for a project with other team members. Each one had a section of audio and had to create their portion and then "stitch it" together with the other parts (of the poem). Michael animated his text and timed it to the audio while adding a storm to go with the mood of the narrative.</p>

<p>Michael created this Video Documentary and included original Animated Text made using Adobe Creative Cloud and Apple Final Cut Pro. It's impossible to know where his work begins and ends because it's expertly bleneded in. He recieved an A and the admiration of his classmates for his work with the timing and color treatments in his animated additions to the professional video footage he used in making this video. It was all used under public access copyright usage for his school work. A common use of commercial work for students in these programs.</p>

<p>Michael created this basic animation on a contract for AARP. The users consuming these animations were better served by simplifiied motion. The Supervising contact provided detailed, organized, and easy to understand design specs. Michael reports he enjoyed working on these even though he was working othter jobs at the same time due to getting hired more than he had predicted. He took too many jobs and learned how hard it is to work without sleeping. He says thanks, but no thanks, to sleep deprivation!</p>

<p>2. Collection of your Personal Information<br/><br/>We do not collect personally identifiable information from our visitors and we  have no plans to gather personal information in the future. Information about  your computer hardware and software may be automatically collected by this site  as a part of routine logging functions and is not personally identifiable to you. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names,  access times, and referring website addresses. This information is used for the operation of the site, to maintain the integrity of the site's compatibility with the browser and operating system combinations accessing the site, and to  provide general statistics regarding use of this site by its visitors.

<p>3. Use of Cookies<br/><br/>This website may use "cookies" to help improve compatibility with  your browser / operating system combination by tracking the various  combinations that require special programming. In order to enhance your  experience by maintaining a consistent experience for you, it is sometimes  necessary to program parts of our site differently on our end, so that you  experience a consistent experience on your end. This requires that we track  those combinations using "cookies." <br/>
<br/> 
A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server.  Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer.  Cookies are uniquely assigned to your browser / operating system combination  and are not uniquely assigned to you or any representation of a personally  identifiable artifact representing you. Cookies can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie.

To avoid this, we detect your environment to attempt to provide the necessary version of functionality that works best with your browsing environment and that does not require you to install additional software.

<br/><br/>Another purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned to a specific page with a recognized browsing environment.

<p>4. Security of your Personal Information<br/><br/>

Sensitive information is not transmitted to or from this site; however, the site is available in a Secure Sockets Layer connection in order to provide a secure link between our web server and your browser. This reduces the opportunity for the site's pages or content to be intercepted in transit and altered. We believe every practical, prudent, and feasible precaution should be taken to safeguard against cyber threats.</p>

This site does not and cannot knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of thirteen because this site does not have any function that would allow a visitor to identify themselves by their age, gender, or any other personally identifiable demographic.
