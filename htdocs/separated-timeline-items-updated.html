<h4>2016 - Present</h4>
<h4 class="subheading">Mastered CSS Animation: <br/>Worked Independently.</h4>
</div>
<div class="timeline-body">
<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">I've been building websites professionally since 2016, working with everyone from small business owners to massive organizations like IBM and the Department of Defense. Many of my clients came to me after buying fancy websites they didn’t have the time or skills to maintain. I stepped in not only to keep things running, but to help them understand what was working, what wasn’t, and how to fix it. Along the way, I gained firsthand knowledge about how decisions get made inside big corporations versus small businesses—and what it really takes to get results in each world. Whether it was working as a solo entrepreneur or as part of a team buried under layers of subcontracting, I learned how to adapt and deliver.

<br/>
<br/>

Now I've mastered CSS Animation, which is a very specialized application of multimedia, web, graphic, hand-coding, timing, and technical savvy. It’s where art meets engineering. I use it to bring websites and digital content to life—adding movement, rhythm, and emotion to things most people think of as static. It’s a rare skill, and I’ve made it my signature. It’s not just about making things look cool (though they do); it’s about making digital experiences feel natural, fluid, and alive. 

<br/>
<br/>
<strong>What's Next?</strong> What's next is that I'm going to animate these tiny experiences and 'time them' to DJ-mixed music I make. I may animate them to commercial music or I may choose Flirty-POP EDM. I haven't decided. But it'll be epic (in an under-stated way; I guarantee that!

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Michael initially struggled with pricing his services, inadvertently undercharging for the quality he provided. This led to attracting clients who undervalued his work, often expecting services for free. Through these challenges, Michael learned the importance of establishing clear legal agreements to ensure payment for services rendered. To further enhance his skills, he enrolled in Full Sail University, aiming to refine his craft even though his quality was already well-regarded. However, the difficulty in holding clients accountable eventually prompted Michael to leave school and focus on finding stable work opportunities instead.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">After graduating from American University, Michael applied his education and experience to develop Phantom Records' website into a rich, multimedia, database-driven site. After updating the site to the most modern it can be, his employer, Phantom Records, moved the site into maintenance mode. Without a site to apply his talents, Michael negotiated the option to take on contracts that would allow him to remain current and broaden his skill set. Between 2013 and now, Michael completed several contracts building sites for the TSA, the Glenmont United Methodist Church, and a start-up government contractor.

<br/>
<br/>

Now that Michael has demonstrated his ability to create modern, database-driven websites, he is broadening his skill set with bleeding-edge Web Design, JavaScript Web Development, and Data Visualization Programming for the NIH. Michael's longer-term plan is to master both the creative and technical aspects of creating electronic experiences. Additionally, he is under the direction of his mentor, learning the software development lifecycle to round out his skills with project management and business development. In a few years, his expertise will equip him to contribute to enterprise-level, web-based projects and step in at any stage to ensure the beauty of its design, the soundness of its programming, and the success of the project through professional project management. He will be a valuable asset on any web-based project.

<p class="text-muted" style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after Michael was hired at a promising new start-up, the tragic events of 9/11 led investors to withdraw funding, forcing the company to shut down. With start-up funding drying up across Silicon Valley, Michael decided it was the perfect opportunity to return to school. Seeking a more fulfilling educational experience, he moved to the East Coast and enrolled at American University, where he designed a unique degree program combining Graphic Design, Multimedia, and Web Programming. This initiative led to Michael earning the only Bachelor of Science in Multimedia Design and Development in the University's history. While attending school part-time, he worked part-time to immediately apply his studies to real-world projects. On May 8, 2011, he graduated with a 3.49 GPA and was honored to walk with the University’s top-performing students.

<p class="text-muted">When traveling between school and work became too grueling, Michael's high school friend invited him to move to New Zealand for a change of pace. There, Michael created an online video game retailer that received 1.2 million hits in its first year. He and his partner made the front page of New Zealand's largest newspaper and were featured on television as an innovative, technology-based retailer. At the time, theirs was the only website featuring videos of gameplay to overcome buyer's reluctance and give customers a preview of gameplay before purchasing. A little-known fact about Michael is that Amazon.com cited Michael's website, www.gamescape.co.nz, in its Patent document US7792705. You can copy and paste this link to see that document and search for www.gamescape.co.nz to see Michael's citation at: <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US7792705">patents.google.com</a>.

<br/>
<br/>

During the time Michael was in New Zealand, the dot-com bubble started growing. Unemployment in the U.S. hit an all-time low of 4.6%. Tech companies were searching high and low for creative talent to fuel innovative start-ups. When Michael's parent learned of this, they made Michael move back to the United States to seek more lucrative employment than they estimated he would find in New Zealand. Michael was engaged to get married and he was forced to break off his engagement and leave his girlfriend. It set a stage for a tumultuous relationship with his parents from then onward.


<br/>
<br/>

Michael moved back to the United States to leverage his experience in his New Zealand start-up and grow his experience in the larger, more competitive U.S. market. In Los Gatos, California, Michael learned the value of separating the front-end from the back-end so specialized talent can be more productive. Michael was promoted to Product Manager after creating a prototype to redesign his employer's software interface based on user feedback. Later, he was promoted to Director of User Interface Design. Michael's work helped sell their web application and their start-up for several hundred thousand dollars and won Michael an invitation to join the same executive team at their next start-up.

He took a job at a computer store as a salesperson and technician so he could personally build the products he sold. He also attended animation school to continue his pursuit of digital design. He learned customer service and technical support and then moved on to network administration, obtaining his Novell Netware Certification and earning $60 an hour doing network "house calls." Michael's boss called his computers "bullet-proof." It may have had something to do with Michael's 27-step preparation plan used on every computer he built.

He also used Mozilla during its first launch and was excited about his future. Researching the Foundation's library revealed a computer animation school in Sunnyvale, California. Immediately following his internship's end, Michael applied, was accepted, enrolled and moved to Sunnyvale to attend.

Back then, computers were slower and relatively more expensive. Michael learned to design on a small black and white screen using Super Paint on a Mac SE/30 and ran the mail merge for the studio's marketing campaign using Microsoft Word. The company was attempting a Work from Home model and if only A.I. had been available then, we could have done it, successfully. Work from Home offices are less likely to suffer a pandemic and less likely to spread infectious disease between workers.

Michael attended CPS in Oakland, California, where he acclimated to intellectual rigor, problem-solving, critical thinking, and teamwork through sports. The University of California recognizes CPS as an honors institution because all classes are taught at the honors level. Michael graduated with a 3.5 GPA, which, when adjusted for honors-level coursework, translates to a 4.5 GPA under the grading system used by post-secondary institutions and universities.
