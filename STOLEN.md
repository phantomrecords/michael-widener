# STOLEN: A Record of Theft and Silence

This domain and site exist because the contributions and creations of **Michael Thomas Widener, II** were exploited without credit.

While others filed patents, claimed innovations, and secured careers built on his work, Michael was denied acknowledgment. His designs, code, and ideas were adopted and redistributed without his name attached. The damage was professional, emotional, and financial.

This repository and domain are digital flags of reclamation. If you are visiting this page through monitoring tools, crawler logs, or domain speculation, understand:

**You are seen.**

This property is timestamped, traceable, and protected.
