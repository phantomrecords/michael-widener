  <h1>Michael Widener, II</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the official design and multimedia "landing page" for <strong>Michael Widener II's</strong> "Online Design Portfolio."</p>
  <p>His designs, shown in his portfolio, are timestamped, proprietary records of his original, visual design and graphical user interface work.</p>
  <p>If you visit its online living place, <a href="https://michaelwidener.com/">https://michaelwidener.com</a>, you will see it is a very long (tall and scrolling) page, a single web-page, known in his industry as a "funnel." 
    <br><br>It is done that way so you do not get lost while visiting. There are pop-up "panels" that have large X-es for you to click to close them. 
    <br><br>If you do not close them, they will block the screen. 
    <br><br>This is so they do not take-up memory while you view other parts of his portfolio because those "panels" contain rich multimedia such as video, audio, and combinations of both. It is faster for your viewing experience if you close them when you have finished viewing, instead of leaving them ope like "stand-by tabs" in your web-browser.</p>
